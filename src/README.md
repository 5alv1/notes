# School notes
Hello there again! This will be the site where I'll push my notes on various courses I follow in my university, everything not uni-related will not be present here and it will be either on the [main site](https://5alv1.github.io) or the [writeup site](https://5alv1.github.io/CTFs-writeups/). The notes are free and you can contribute in other folders (for example [this folder](https://5alv1.github.io/notes/ITALIAN_NOTES/)), you can use these notes however you want!

Mind that this is technically a different site from the principal one, so I'm giving you [this link](https://5alv1.github.io) in case you get lost and you are too lazy to edit the url.
