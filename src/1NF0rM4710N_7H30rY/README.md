These notes are about the course "INFORMATION AND TRANSMISSION THEORY", which is a fundamental course to see the practical aspect of statistics, and it plays an important role in decision models and machine learning.

There are some mathematical aspects that need to be discussed in order to understand better the course, so I will cover some of it in the first post of this section.
